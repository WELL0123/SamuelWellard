       <p> Name: Samuel Wellard </p>
       <p> Student Number: s3921205 </p>
       <p> Student Email: s3921205@student.rmit.edu.au	</p>
       <p> Previous Education: St. Pius X College (2006-13), Northern Sydney Institute (2014,2019), Macquarie University (2015-18) </p>
       <p> Fun Fact: I have been a massive Harry Potter fan in terms of both the books and films ever since I read the first book and saw the first film in 2001. From then on, it has been a key element in what shaped me and entertained me while I grew up. Fortunately in 2019 while on a trip through England, Ireland and France myself and my two brothers were lucky enough to bump into Brendan Gleeson (Mad-Eye Moody) in a cafe in rural Ireland. </p>

  <h1> Interest in IT </h1>
<article>
  <p> I have always had an interest in IT. Whether it was playing PC games with my brother when I was at primary school, or wanting to understand how to connect my iPod and iPad to iTunes to download music, apps and videos. Figuring out how to navigate the different interfaces of a PC, iPod and iPad were fun and challenging yet ‘basic’. My experience with IT before 2019 had been very surface level. I’d always wanted to know how to use something, but never much more than that. As long as I, the user, knew how the product was meant to work as intended I was fine. As long as I could login and create my Facebook profile I was content. </p>
  <p> It might sound a bit silly, but what sparked me to want to have a deeper understanding of IT was the show Mr. Robot. While there is action away from laptops and PC’s, a lot of what matters and dictates the story is done through networking and the Command Line Interface. While the show does a decent job at allowing people with no IT knowledge to know what’s happening in a broad narrative sense, I did feel lost at times when the characters were in front of their screens, which is what prompted me to study Cyber Security Certificate IV at Tafe in 2019. </p>
  <p> Within that course I was introduced to virtual machines, Splunk, networking and even wrote our own pentesting and IRTX project together in a group. As interesting and fun as the course was, I wouldn’t say it was enough to propel you straight into the workforce. That’s why I have decided to pursue further study at RMIT. From the universities that I looked into RMIT seemed the most beneficial in terms of the subject matter that I wanted to study. It also had very high reviews and allowed me to study even though I live in Sydney. My expectations of my time at RMIT are that hopefully they are successful and that it will equip me with the respective skills and knowledge to find my way in the IT job landscape. I’m sure there will be some overlap from my 2019 course, but I’m hoping that techniques and knowledge will be reinforced with these studies. </p>

  <p> Software and Applications Programmers, as per the link above is described as designing, developing, testing and maintaining program code within software and applications. Considering that my project idea is to create an app to make organising teams and officials at weekend sports easier, this was a job I wanted to seek out and see if I could forge a path towards in the future.<br />Key skills that are prerequisites to be a successful Programmer include sufficient knowledge in programming, systems evaluation, systems analysis, decision making and problem thinking/critical thinking. Bachelor and Postgraduate degrees are recommended as a base foundation. </p>
  <p> Currently my experience and qualifications that have any relevance would be a Certificate IV in Cyber Security in 2019. We didn’t study much programming throughout that course, so ideally I would bring experience from what I learnt during that course and the programming experience that is offered through this Bachelor’s degree. <br /> At this moment in time my current goal to reach this job is to finish this degree, and depending on where I am in my life and career, look to complete a Postgraduate degree. </p>

<p> The results from the above tests don't really surprise me. I have always been quite an introverted person, and have had trouble being personable to people I don’t know. It is not an intentional decision, I like to sit back and let people who are more comfortable with expressing themselves and ideas do so first, then contribute or express myself once I’ve gotten to know their personalities a bit. I hope these results can push me to become more personable and expressive in a team. <br /> I would hate to be seen as the anti-social group member that other members do not look forward to working with. With these results I will look toward being more empathetic, less disconnected and impatient. These three improvements to my personality are what great team mates and teams are built on. I know that the subjects are completely different, but I find that if my cricket team during the summer apply these traits, then the team harmony is amplified. <br /> These traits also work during the summer as the level of cricket that I play is not very high, so teammates are making a lot of mistakes. I feel that is what level many of the students in this class are arriving at, including myself, so patience and empathy will go a long way in supporting one another. </p>

  <h1> Project Idea - Australian Sports Manager Application (Android/iOS) </h1>
<article>
<p> Overview: </p>
<p> Australian Sports Manager (ASM) is an application designed for Android and iOS that allows participants in weekend sports during all seasons of the year to manage squads and officiating availability. ASM is designed for captains and managers and to relieve as much stress from team and officiating selection and availability as possible. <br /> ASM will have users store their personal information and weekend availability as well as the team or squad they are part of throughout the season or weekend. It will streamline all players of respective clubs and officials into a database of either available or unavailable. </p>
<br />
<p> Motivation: </p>
<p> Around 11 million adults and 3 million children take part in sport each year in Australia. If they are anything like myself and my captains over the years they would have faced difficulty finding enough players to fill the team for the weekend, had players not communicate in Messenger or Whatsapp groups and arrived at the ground to find no officials to run the game. <br /> During my last season playing soccer, we were charged a referee surcharge within our fees. A referee arrived twice to our games, leaving us to usually officiate with a player from either team. It ruins the experience and depletes both teams of a player. MIT App Inventor is an easily available tool to help build infrastructure to fix this problem. </p>
<br />
<p> Description: </p>

  <p> Australian Sports Manager (ASM) will allow users to login and create a profile. Users will then designate whether they are a player or official. Users can designate as both. </p>
<ul>
       <li> Eg. If user plays on Saturday then officiates on Sunday </li>
       <li> As an official, user selects which association they are enrolled in (Eg North Shore Cricket Association - NSCA) </li>
       <li> Once the association has been selected it will allocate you to which matches you have been selected to officiate in. The roster depends on how many officials have been registered for that season </li>
</ul>
<p> As officials, you will be asked to nominate your availability in 6 week blocks. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Even if you are not rostered for a certain round, you still must give an availability status in case officials rostered cannot make the game. </li>
  <li> Players can give availability status week to week, or admins can send out certain week blocks to be filled in </li>
  <li> Admins/Associations can set deadlines each week that you must modify your status by for players and officials (Eg. 9.30pm every Thursday) </li>
</ul>
<p> Phone number, email address and home address will be needed to be added to the profile. This will be key information when it comes time to selecting players and officials. </p>
<p> Users will be able to add their clubs to their profiles, then select which team they are part of for that season (Eg. 1st Grade, 5th Grade, 6th Grade etc.). </p>
<ul>
  <li> Selecting which grade you are in allows you to see the other teams also in that grade </li>
  <li> It will also show a fixture list of the home and away season with designated officials </li>
  <li> Squad chat will be made available (like Messenger, Whatsapp) in the Squad tab </li>
</ul>
<p> Captain and Vice Captain tags will be able to be added to profiles. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Admin tags can be added as well. Profiles with admin tags may message between other profiles with the same tag </li>
  <li> It is our main intention that captains and vice captains be able to message between one another on match day </li>
  <li> Officials can message captains and vice captains. Our aim is to streamline and minimize communication conflict </li>
</ul>
<p> Captains/Admins will ask in the squad chat to give availability. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Admins will set a deadline to availability status </li>
  <li> User will click on the Fixtures tab and choose relevant fixture </li>
  <li> Available (green circle, white tick) and Unavailable (red circle, white x) will appear. User clicks relevant status </li>
</ul>
<p> Captain/Admin will go to the Select Squad tab. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Users who have made their status available will be shown </li>
  <li> Once a set deadline has been passed, Captain/Admin chooses from available squad </li>
  <li> Once they have submitted their team, players can go to the Team tab and see who has been selected </li>
  <li> All players who were available and have been selected will have a small relevant sport emoji next to their name (Eg. cricket bat/ball) </li>
  <li> Players who were not selected but available will have a green circle and white tick next to their name as well as a Not Selected tag underneath their name </li>
</ul>
<p> If other teams at the club lose a player the morning of the match due to unforeseen circumstances, Captains may go to the Not Selected tab to see who they can bring into the team. App will ask for live location and sort players by location to a destination. (Eg. type in address of oval). </p>
<ul>
  <li> Player name and grade will pop up in descending order to closest to location. Player info will display phone number and address </li>
</ul>
<p> Similar situations can be followed if officials message captains through the messenger options between Admins. </p>
<ul>
  <li> If officials cannot arrive at the game, captains may go to the Officials tab and sort by not selected. A live location will be prompted and addresses and phone numbers of available officials will be given </li>
</ul>

  <h1> Skills Required </h1>
  <article>
  <p> Product Management Skills (Vital Link): </p>
  <ul>
    <li> The product manager (our team) for an app creator is the crucial link between the design team and the client. We need to delve into the business requirements of the app and uncover our unified vision. We have to  make sure the team shares that vision. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Design Skills (Appearance and Feel): </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Clients don’t want unattractive apps and icons on their high-tech smartphones. They need our app to be attractive as well as delivering a smooth experience. Our group should possess design skills that interest and encourage people to want to use our app. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Writing Skills: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Ensure that our team incorporates high-quality writing. If the text on our app seems like it was created by an amateur, we need to be more conscious of the writing. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> QA and Performance Testing Skills (Continued Stability): </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Our group will need to have strong QA screening systems in place. Apps that are uncomplicated can lull several companies into concentrating on speed instead of quality. It is not advisable for us to cut corners for our  QA testing process. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Clean Coding: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We’ll need to decide as a group what will be the suitable coding language such as HTML5, Java, C++, Objective-C, Swift and C#, and produce clean code.
 </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Cross-Platform Skills (Android/iOS/Windows): </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Decide as a group what platforms to prioritise (Android/ iOS). Any potentially successful app will ultimately need to be converted to run on all the most popular platforms. Critical that our team employs a cross-platform tool. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Data Skills (Information): </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Data is what we'll collect and how we’ll know our end-results.This suggests that we’ll need experienced data engineers to build the most useful databases and repositories achievable. A well-designed database can result in a smoother, better performing app. </li>
  </ul>

  <h1> Outcome </h1>
  <article>
  <p> If the Australian Sports Manager Application is successful, I’d like to think that it has helped streamline and uncomplicate organisation of teams and officials for weekend sport in Australia. Of course, that is still reliant on user input within the application but I feel as though the ASM app can give users an easy experience and simple interface to help with this issue. <br /> When fully released, I hope that organising teams and calling up players and officials for last minute absences will be an easier and less stressful process. Helping the weekend sport experience flow smoother for everyone can only attract more people to join and create a better atmosphere among players and officials.  </p>
